1，Two sum quesions and its follow up:

basic two sum: leetcode 1;
For sorted array: use two pointer can save extra space;
For unsorted array: use hashmap will only cost O(n), take O(n) extra space. Two pointer will cost O(n)
3SUM: leetcode 15 (make use of 2SUM, difficult part is remove duplicate)
follow up: 3SUM closest: leetcode 16
Valid Triangle Number: leetcode 611
Two Sum Closest: 看视频思路。





2，Partition Array:

example: 
this.partition array.java
quick sort: this.quick sort
