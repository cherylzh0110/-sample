1.Two Sum - Difference equals to target

2.sliding window problem:
Note: -how to move the left and right pointer is very important and applicable to all the sliding window problem.
      -it's common to record the frequency of character in the process of moving pointer.
Minimum Window Substring lc 76   //this question is the pointer in the same direction. It's like a window.
Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: lc 3
Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters: lc 395   //比较特殊，考前需记忆。
Permutation in String: lc 567

3.特殊：
Increasing Triplet Subsequence: lc334
Longest Mountain in Array: lc845. 有点类似于sliding window, 一个值到位后，变化另一个值。

相向双指针：
1，Two sum quesions and its follow up:   two sum is the two pointers in different directions.
Basic two sum:
two pointer method:   https://www.jiuzhang.com/solutions/two-sum/
hashmap method: leetcode 1
Note: -For sorted array: use two pointer can save extra space;
      -For unsorted array: use hashmap will only cost O(n), take O(n) extra space. Two pointer will cost O(n)
follow up: Two Sum Closest: 比two sum多出来的地方就是在过程中要记录一下difference。 看this. two sum questions

3SUM: leetcode 15 (make use of 2SUM, difficult part is remove duplicate)
follow up: 3SUM closest: leetcode 16

4SUM: lc18 (make use of 2SUM and 3SUM, should remove duplicate in all functions.)

2.Valid Triangle Number: leetcode 611  trick is (for the sorted array, we just need to consider whether a+b>c! that's enough)


3.Partition Array:

example: 
this.partition array.java
quick sort: this.quick sort
quick select: this.quick_select        https://www.lintcode.com/problem/kth-smallest-numbers-in-unsorted-array/my-submissions

4.
this.quick sort
this.rainbow sort: combine of quick sort and merge sort!
