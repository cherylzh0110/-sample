Segment Tree is used in cases where there are multiple range queries on array and modifications of elements of the same array. 
For example, finding the sum of all the elements in an array from indices  L to R , 
or finding the minimum (famously known as Range Minumum Query problem) of all the elements in an array from indices L to R. 
These problems can be easily solved with one of the most versatile data structures, Segment Tree.


UPDATE()  O(logn)
SearchRange()  O(logn)
assume the number of calls to update and sumRange function is distributed evenly, it is very convenient to use segment tree.

Build() cost O(n), n is usually the input array size. 


Ex:

Range Sum Query - Mutable: lc 307
