1. Priority Queue

the concept of comparator and the difference between comparator and comparable. (for comparator, we don't need to change class,
Class whose objects to be sorted do not need to implement this Comparator interface. Some third class can implement this interface to sort.
comparable: This interface has one method compareTo. Class whose objects to be sorted must implement this Comparable interface. 
that means for different sort ways, we need to change the class differently.)
