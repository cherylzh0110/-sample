Balanced Binary Tree: leetcode 110
Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Path Sum: leetcode 112,113,437

Divide & Conquer:  
Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree: lc 235 236. remember if(root==null || root==p || root==q) is the return condition.
                                                                        return root;
Reverse Pair: lc 493 (using mergesort)
Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum: lc124
Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal: lc106 (trick is the last element in postorder array is the root)
